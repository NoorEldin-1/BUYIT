🚀 Project Description
BUYIT is a user-friendly e-commerce platform designed to simplify product sales through WhatsApp. The project is divided into two main components: a powerful control panel for the owner and a seamless, intuitive website for customers.

🔐 Admin Control Panel
This is the command center for the website owner. It provides comprehensive control over the platform, allowing the owner to:

📦 Manage and view all product data.

📂 Organize products into sections and categories.

👥 Monitor user activity and manage registered users.

🛍️ User Website
The front-facing website allows users to browse and interact with products. We've focused on making the user experience as smooth as possible.

Key Features:

One-Click Sign-In: Registration is streamlined for convenience, requiring only a single click via a Google account.

Favorites List ❤️: Registered users can add products to their favorites list, allowing them to easily save items they like for later.

Simple Purchase Process: Users can add desired products to their shopping cart. Upon clicking "Purchase," they are redirected to WhatsApp to communicate directly with the website owner. The initial WhatsApp message automatically includes a detailed list of the selected products, making the purchasing process efficient and personal.
